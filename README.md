# EVA4 - TSAI
*This repo is related to EVA Program(Extensive Vision AI) offered by The School of AI, Bangalore. It consists of Assignments(& Solutions), Notes, Projects related to the course etc.*


18 Sessions spanned over 15 weeks, 2 hours per session is what will make Phase 1. This would be covering tons of research papers and their implementations i.e InceptionNet, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet etc.

Till now 9 sessions are completed. I will briefly summarise what I have learned and share some insights here. Star this Repo and Stay Tuned for upcoming sessions.
