## Neural Architecture

Neural Nets also called as Artificial Neural Network(ANN) are computing systems that can learn on its own. NNs generally perform supervised learning tasks, building knowledge from data sets where the right answer is provided in advance. The networks then learn by tuning themselves to find the right answer on their own, increasing the accuracy of their predictions.
