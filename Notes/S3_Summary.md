**Kernels, Activation & Layers**

CNNs follow the hierarchy strictly like first Edges & Gradients are detected, then something complicated like Textures & Patterns are formed as a result of some operation/s conducted on Edges by Kernels and this process goes on and on till 'N'-defined Epochs.

* But the problem arises when you try to increase the number of channels after MaxPooling Layers. And this can be solved using 3x3 Kernel. But it's not effecient since there's sudden surge in number of params after MaxPool Layer.
